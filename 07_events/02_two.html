    /*
    - JavaScript
      - Synchronous language:
            JavaScript, by default, executes code in a synchronous, sequential manner.
            This means that each line of code is executed one after the other,
            and the next line doesn't execute until the current one is finished.

      - Single thread:
            JavaScript's execution environment (in most browsers and Node.js) is single-threaded.
            This means that it can only execute one task at a time.

        However, it is important to note that javascript can perform asynchronous operations. This is done by using things like:
        - Callbacks
        - Promises
        - Async/await
        - Web APIs

    - Execution context 
        - Execute one line of code at a time.
        - Each operation waits for thr last one to complete before executing.
    
    - Two types of code:-
        - Blocking code -> Block the flow of program. for eg. reading file synchronously.
        - Non Blocking code -> Does not block execution. for eg. reading file Asynchronously.

    - setTimeout(function, delay): Executes the function once after the specified delay (in milliseconds).
    - setInterval(function, interval): Executes the function repeatedly at every specified interval (in milliseconds), until stopped.
